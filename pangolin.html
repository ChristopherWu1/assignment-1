        Pangolins are mammels that are found in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. They range from 12 to 39 inches and live in hollow trees or burrows. 
        They are nocturnal animals and have a diet of ants and termites, which they get with their long tongue. The most striking features pangolins have are their scales!
        They are made from keratin, the same material made from fingernails and toenails. It protects itself by curling into a ball, only exposing the sharp scales to predators. They 
        also can omit a foul stench from their glands, similar to a skunk.Pangolins unfortunately are in danger of being extinct due to deforestation and illegal trafficking. 
        Their scales and flesh are perceived to have healing properties and used in Chinese and other Asian medience.
