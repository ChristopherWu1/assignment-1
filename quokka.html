        Quokkas, also known as the short-tailed scrub wallaby, are small marcopods that are native to the small islands off the western Coast of Australia.
        It is about the size of a small cat, weighing up to 11 pounds and 12 inches tall. They are nocturnal and climbs tree branches to escape the heat during the day.
        Babies are kept inside the mother's pouch, just like a Kangaroo! They are vegiterian and require lots of water to be hydrated. Quokkas are not scared of humans and will
        walk up to them with little care. They have gotten popular on social media due to their beaming smiles.
